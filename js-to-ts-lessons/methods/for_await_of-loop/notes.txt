The **`for await...of`** loop is an advanced JavaScript construct used to iterate over **asynchronous iterable objects**, such as streams, or when dealing with iterables (like arrays) that contain **Promises**.

It was introduced in **ES2018** and provides a clean, synchronous-looking syntax for consuming asynchronous data sources.

-----

## Key Function and Syntax

The primary role of `for await...of` is to pause execution at each iteration, wait for the asynchronous data (Promise) to resolve, and then provide the resolved **value** before moving to the next iteration.

### Syntax

```javascript
async function consumeAsyncData() {
  for await (const element of asyncIterable) {
    // 'element' is the resolved value of the Promise for the current iteration
    console.log(element);
  }
}
```

### Requirements

1.  It can **only** be used inside an **`async`** function.
2.  The object being iterated over (`asyncIterable`) must be an **Async Iterable** (i.e., it must have a `[Symbol.asyncIterator]` method).

-----

## How It Works ðŸ’¡

The most common use case is iterating over an array of Promises, where you need to process them sequentially.

### Example: Processing Promises Sequentially

In this common pattern, we want to ensure each Promise is fully resolved before starting the next one.

```javascript
// A utility function that returns a Promise which resolves after a delay
function delayedValue(value, ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Resolved: ${value}`);
      resolve(value);
    }, ms);
  });
}

// An array containing Promises
const promiseArray = [
  delayedValue('A', 2000), // Takes 2 seconds
  delayedValue('B', 1000), // Takes 1 second
  delayedValue('C', 500)   // Takes 0.5 seconds
];

async function processPromises() {
  console.log("Starting Sequential Processing...");
  
  // The loop pauses for the time taken by each Promise to resolve
  for await (const result of promiseArray) {
    console.log(`Processing resolved result: ${result}`);
  }

  console.log("All processing finished.");
}

processPromises();
```

**Execution Flow (Total time $\approx$ 3.5 seconds):**

1.  Loop starts with Promise 'A', pauses for 2s.
2.  Promise 'A' resolves, loop prints **"Processing resolved result: A"**.
3.  Loop moves to Promise 'B', pauses for 1s.
4.  Promise 'B' resolves, loop prints **"Processing resolved result: B"**.
5.  Loop moves to Promise 'C', pauses for 0.5s.
6.  Promise 'C' resolves, loop prints **"Processing resolved result: C"**.
7.  Final message prints.

## `for await...of` vs. `for...of`

| Feature | `for await...of` | `for...of` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Source** | **Async Iterable** (e.g., Node.js Streams, an Array of Promises). | **Iterable** (e.g., Array, String, Map, Set). |
| **Execution** | **Stops and awaits** the resolution of each item's Promise. | Synchronously processes the value of each item. |
| **Context** | **Must** be inside an `async` function. | Can be used in any function context. |
| **Value** | Returns the **resolved value** of the Promise. | Returns the raw value of the element. |

### Note on Iterating Arrays

When iterating over a regular array using `for await...of`, the loop behaves exactly like a regular `for...of` loop if the array elements are not Promises. However, if the array contains Promises (as in the example above), the `for await...of` loop is the clean, readable way to await them sequentially.
