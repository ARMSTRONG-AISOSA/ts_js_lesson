The split() method is allows you to break a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator.

How it Works
The basic syntax is string.split(separator).

--string: The string you want to split.
--separator (optional): The string or regular expression at which to split the string. The separator itself is not included in any of the new array's elements.

If you don't provide a separator, split() returns the original string as a single-element array.

Common Uses
1. Tokenizing Text: Breaking down a long string of text into an array of words, sentences, or paragraphs for analysis.

2. Parsing Data: Extracting individual data points from a string that uses a consistent separator, such as a hyphen or a pipe character.

3. String Manipulation: It's the first step in the famous chain of methods used to reverse a string: string.split('').reverse().join('').

Important Notes
Original String: split() does not change the original string. It always returns a new array.

Limiting Splits: You can also pass a second, optional argument to split() to limit the number of splits. For example, sentence.split(" ", 2) would only split the first two words.

The split() method is a foundational tool for working with and manipulating string data in JavaScript.
