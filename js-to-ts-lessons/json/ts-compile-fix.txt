The TypeScript compiler is complaining because by default itâ€™s compiling to ES5, which does not have Promise or async/await built in.

Thatâ€™s why youâ€™re getting errors like:
    --Cannot find global value 'Promise'
    --'Promise' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.
    --An async function or method in ES5 requires the 'Promise' constructor

ðŸ”§ Fix
You need to tell TypeScript to target a newer version of JavaScript (es2015 or later) so that it knows about Promise and async/await.

Option 1: Pass options directly
Run:
    tsc json.ts --target es2015 --lib es2015,dom
```
--target es2015: compiles to modern JS with promises + async/await.
--lib es2015,dom: adds the Promise, console, and localStorage definitions.

âš¡ Quick Note
    --If you only run in Node.js, you donâ€™t need "dom".
    --If you run in the browser (youâ€™re using localStorage), you must include "dom".
