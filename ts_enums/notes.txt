What is an Enum?

An enum (short for enumeration) is a way to define a collection of related values that you can refer to by name instead of number or string.

âœ… When to Use Enums
    --To represent fixed sets of values (e.g., directions, user roles, states).
    --When you want readable names instead of magic numbers/strings.
    --When values need to be consistent across your app.


ðŸ’¡ Example: User Roles

enum Role {
  Admin = "ADMIN",
  User = "USER",
  Guest = "GUEST"
}

function checkAccess(role: Role) {
  if (role === Role.Admin) {
    console.log("Full access granted");
  } else {
    console.log("Limited access");
  }
}

checkAccess(Role.User); // "Limited access"
